To compile code, place FileCopy.c and child.c in the same directory.

Run the command prompt with admin privileges and type in "gcc -o (filename1).exe FileCopy.c" and "gcc -o (filename2).exe child.c".

Once the exe has been created in the directory, create a source or input file in the same directory. 

Enter in the command prompt "(filename1).exe source.txt destination.txt". 

If you have issues with that command try to be more specific with the pathname of the of the source and destination files like "(filename1).exe "C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\source.txt" "C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\destination.txt""
